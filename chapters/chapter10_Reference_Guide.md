## Neural Network Fundamentals Cheat Sheet üß†

### Neural Network Types at a Glance

| Network Type | Best For | Architecture | Key Features | AWS Implementation |
|-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Feedforward** | Tabular data, classification, regression | Input ‚Üí Hidden Layers ‚Üí Output | Simple, fully connected | SageMaker Linear Learner, XGBoost |
| **CNN** | Images, spatial data | Convolutional + Pooling Layers | Local patterns, spatial hierarchy | SageMaker Image Classification, Object Detection |
| **RNN/LSTM** | Sequences, time series, text | Recurrent connections | Memory of previous inputs | SageMaker DeepAR, BlazingText |
| **Transformer** | Text, sequences, images | Self-attention mechanism | Parallel processing, long-range dependencies | SageMaker Hugging Face, JumpStart |

### Activation Functions Decision Matrix

| Activation | Output Range | Use For | Advantages | Disadvantages | Best Practice |
|------------|--------------|---------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| **ReLU** | [0, ‚àû) | Hidden layers | Fast, reduces vanishing gradient | Dead neurons | Default for most hidden layers |
| **Sigmoid** | (0, 1) | Binary output | Smooth, probabilistic | Vanishing gradient | Binary classification output |
| **Softmax** | (0, 1), sums to 1 | Multi-class output | Probability distribution | Computationally expensive | Multi-class classification output |
| **Tanh** | (-1, 1) | Hidden layers, RNNs | Zero-centered | Vanishing gradient | RNN/LSTM cells, normalization |
| **Leaky ReLU** | (-‚àû, ‚àû) | Hidden layers | No dead neurons | Additional parameter | When ReLU has dead neuron problems |
| **Linear** | (-‚àû, ‚àû) | Regression output | Unbounded output | No non-linearity | Regression output layer |

### Backpropagation Quick Reference

**The Process:**
1. **Forward Pass:** Calculate predictions and loss
2. **Backward Pass:** Calculate gradients of loss with respect to weights
3. **Update:** Adjust weights using gradients and learning rate

**Key Formulas:**
```
Weight Update: w_new = w_old - learning_rate * gradient
Gradient: ‚àÇLoss/‚àÇw
Chain Rule: ‚àÇLoss/‚àÇw = ‚àÇLoss/‚àÇoutput * ‚àÇoutput/‚àÇw
```

**Common Problems:**
- **Vanishing Gradient:** Gradients become too small in deep networks
  - *Solution:* ReLU activation, residual connections, batch normalization
- **Exploding Gradient:** Gradients become too large
  - *Solution:* Gradient clipping, weight regularization, proper initialization

## Regularization Techniques Comparison üõ°Ô∏è

### Preventing Overfitting: Method Selection

| Technique | How It Works | When to Use | Implementation | Effect on Training |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **L1 Regularization** | Adds sum of absolute weights to loss | Feature selection needed | `alpha` parameter | Sparse weights (many zeros) |
| **L2 Regularization** | Adds sum of squared weights to loss | General regularization | `lambda` parameter | Smaller weights overall |
| **Dropout** | Randomly deactivates neurons | Deep networks | `dropout_rate` parameter | Longer training time |
| **Early Stopping** | Stops when validation error increases | Most models | `patience` parameter | Shorter training time |
| **Data Augmentation** | Creates variations of training data | Image/text models | Transformations | Longer training time |
| **Batch Normalization** | Normalizes layer inputs | Deep networks | Add after layers | Faster convergence |

### L1 vs L2 Regularization

**L1 (Lasso):**
- **Mathematical Form:** Loss + Œª‚àë\|w\|
- **Effect:** Creates sparse solutions (many weights = 0)
- **Best For:** Feature selection, high-dimensional data
- **AWS Parameter:** `l1` in Linear Learner, `alpha` in XGBoost

**L2 (Ridge):**
- **Mathematical Form:** Loss + Œª‚àëw¬≤
- **Effect:** Shrinks all weights proportionally
- **Best For:** General regularization, correlated features
- **AWS Parameter:** `l2` in Linear Learner, `lambda` in XGBoost

### Dropout Implementation Guide

**Dropout Rates by Layer Type:**
```
Input Layer: 0.1-0.2 (conservative)
Hidden Layers: 0.3-0.5 (standard)
Recurrent Connections: 0.1-0.3 (careful)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Scale outputs by 1/(1-dropout_rate) during training
- Disable dropout during inference
- Use higher rates for larger networks
- Combine with other regularization techniques

## Model Evaluation Metrics Reference üìä

### Classification Metrics Selection

| Metric | Formula | When to Use | Interpretation | AWS Implementation |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Accuracy** | (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) | Balanced classes | % of correct predictions | Default in most algorithms |
| **Precision** | TP/(TP+FP) | Minimize false positives | % of positive predictions that are correct | `precision` metric |
| **Recall** | TP/(TP+FN) | Minimize false negatives | % of actual positives identified | `recall` metric |
| **F1 Score** | 2√ó(Precision√óRecall)/(Precision+Recall) | Balance precision & recall | Harmonic mean of precision & recall | `f1` metric |
| **AUC-ROC** | Area under ROC curve | Ranking quality | Probability of ranking positive above negative | `auc` metric |
| **Confusion Matrix** | Table of prediction vs. actual | Detailed error analysis | Pattern of errors | SageMaker Model Monitor |

### Regression Metrics Selection

| Metric | Formula | When to Use | Interpretation | AWS Implementation |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **MSE** | Mean((actual-predicted)¬≤) | General purpose | Error magnitude (squared) | `mse` metric |
| **RMSE** | ‚àöMSE | Same scale as target | Error magnitude | `rmse` metric |
| **MAE** | Mean(\|actual-predicted\|) | Robust to outliers | Average error magnitude | `mae` metric |
| **R¬≤** | 1 - (MSE/Variance) | Model comparison | % of variance explained | `r2` metric |
| **MAPE** | Mean(\|actual-predicted\|/\|actual\|) | Relative error | % error | `mape` metric |

### Threshold Selection Guide

**Binary Classification Threshold Considerations:**
```
Higher Threshold (e.g., 0.8):
- Increases precision, decreases recall
- Fewer positive predictions
- Use when false positives are costly

Lower Threshold (e.g., 0.2):
- Increases recall, decreases precision
- More positive predictions
- Use when false negatives are costly

Balanced Threshold (e.g., 0.5):
- Default starting point
- May not be optimal for imbalanced classes
- Consider F1 score for optimization
```

**Threshold Optimization Methods:**
1. **ROC Curve Analysis:** Plot TPR vs. FPR at different thresholds
2. **Precision-Recall Curve:** Plot precision vs. recall at different thresholds
3. **F1 Score Maximization:** Choose threshold that maximizes F1
4. **Business Cost Function:** Incorporate actual costs of errors

2. Comprehend analyzes text for entities and sentiment
3. Translate converts content to target languages
4. Polly converts text to speech for accessibility

Benefits:
- Clear data flow
- Service specialization
- Modular architecture
- Easy to troubleshoot
```

**2. Parallel Processing:**
```
Pattern: Multiple services process same input simultaneously
Example: Content Moderation System

Flow:
- Input: User-generated content
- Parallel processing:
  * Rekognition analyzes images for inappropriate content
  * Comprehend detects toxic text
  * Transcribe converts audio to text for analysis
- Results aggregated for final decision

Benefits:
- Faster processing
- Comprehensive analysis
- Redundancy for critical tasks
- Specialized handling by content type
```

**3. Hybrid Custom/Managed:**
```
Pattern: Combine AI services with custom ML models
Example: Advanced Recommendation System

Flow:
1. Personalize generates base recommendations

3. Business rules filter and adjust final recommendations
4. A/B testing framework evaluates performance

Benefits:
- Best of both worlds
- Leverage pre-built capabilities
- Add custom intelligence
- Faster time-to-market
```

**4. Event-Driven Architecture:**
```
Pattern: Services triggered by events in asynchronous flow
Example: Intelligent Document Processing

Flow:
1. Document uploaded to S3 triggers Lambda
2. Lambda initiates Textract processing
3. Textract completion event triggers analysis Lambda
4. Analysis results stored in DynamoDB
5. Notification sent to user via SNS

Benefits:
- Scalable and resilient
- Decoupled components
- Cost-efficient (pay-per-use)
